    <h1 class="one">DIFFERENT CROPS AND THEIR PRODUCTS </h1>
    <h1>Types of crops</h1>
   <h2>Food Crops</h2>
   <p> Food plants were historically the first to be harvested and cultivated. They are grown for human consumption. <br> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/food-crop">Food crops</a>, particularly grains, are strategically important. At the same time, farmers should keep in mind that while industrial food plant cultivation has many benefits, <br> it can also have negative environmental consequences, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
    
    The following are the types of food crops.
    
    Cereals: wheat, rice, barley, millet, oats, rye, sorghum, and others. Grains are a rich source of starch, protein, dietary fiber, and nutrients and are an integral part of the daily diet. In particular, maize, rice, and wheat provide the most calories and protein consumed in developing countries.</p>
        
       <h2>Rabi Crops </h2>
         <p>The name “Rabi” means “spring” – a word derived from Arabic.
        
        The crops that are grown in the winter season and harvested in the spring are called Rabi crops. <br>
        
        Wheat, gram, and mustard are some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_crop">Rabi crops.</a> <br>
        
        Various agricultural practices are carried out to produce new crop varieties. <br>
        
        Such crops require a warm climate for the germination and maturation of seeds. They, however, require a cold climate for their growth </p>
<h2>Zaid Crops </h2>
   <p>Such crops are grown between the Kharif and Rabi seasons, i.e., between March and June. <br>
  
  These crops mature early. <br>
  
  Cucumber, pumpkin, bitter gourd, and watermelon are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaid_crop#:~:text=In%20between%20the%20Rabi%20and,almost%20a%20year%20to%20grow.">zaid crops</a>.</p>
